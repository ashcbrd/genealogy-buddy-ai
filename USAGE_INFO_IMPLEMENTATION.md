# Non-Blocking Usage Information Implementation

## Summary
Successfully updated the usage tracking system to be informational only, removing blocking elements while maintaining backend restrictions and clear user communication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Blocking UsageGuard ✅
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/tools/document-analyzer/page.tsx`
- Removed `UsageGuard` wrapper that blocked tool access
- Users can now always access the tool interface
- Backend APIs handle the actual restrictions

### 2. Updated Usage Display to be Informational ✅
**File**: `components/ui/usage-guard.tsx`
- Modified `UsageWarning` to show different levels of information:
  - **Subtle info bar** for users with available usage
  - **Warning alert** for users approaching limits (80%+)
  - **Error alert** for users who have reached limits (but doesn't block access)
- All messages inform users they can still try to analyze

### 3. Created New Minimal Usage Info Component ✅
**File**: `components/ui/usage-info.tsx`
- Simple, clean usage display that shows:
  - Current usage count vs limit
  - Plan tier information
  - Upgrade links for easy access
- Non-intrusive single line display

### 4. Backend Restriction Handling Verified ✅
**Files**: `app/api/tools/*/analyze/route.ts`
- All APIs properly enforce limits with appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - **402 Payment Required**: When feature not available in plan
  - **429 Too Many Requests**: When usage limit exceeded
  - Clear error messages explaining the restriction and upgrade path

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Blocking):
1. User reaches usage limit
2. Tool page shows blocking message
3. User cannot access tool interface at all
4. Must upgrade to see the tool

### After (Informational):
1. User sees subtle usage information at top of tool page
2. User can access and use tool interface normally
3. When trying to analyze with limits reached:
   - Frontend sends request to backend
   - Backend returns clear error message about needing to upgrade
   - User sees the error and understands they need to upgrade
4. User can still explore the tool and see its interface

## Benefits

### ✅ Better User Experience
- Users can explore tools even when at limits
- No blocking interfaces or restricted access
- Clear, contextual information about usage status

### ✅ Clear Upgrade Path
- Backend provides specific error messages
- Frontend shows plan information and upgrade links
- Users understand exactly what they need to do

### ✅ Maintained Security
- All restrictions still enforced at API level
- No actual tool usage beyond limits
- Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

### ✅ Flexible Information Display
- Different information for different usage levels
- Subtle for normal usage, prominent for limit issues
- Tier-appropriate messaging

## Implementation Details

### API Error Responses
```json
// When feature not in plan (HTTP 402)
{
  "error": "DNA analysis is not available in your plan. Please upgrade to access this feature."
}

// When usage limit reached (HTTP 429)
{
  "error": "You have reached your monthly limit of 2 document analyses. Please upgrade your plan or wait until next month."
}
```

### Usage Information Display
- **Normal usage**: `Usage this month: 1 / 2 • FREE Plan • Upgrade`
- **Near limit**: Warning alert with remaining count
- **At limit**: Error alert explaining user can try but needs upgrade
- **Unlimited**: Shows tier with crown icon

### Files Modified
1. `app/(dashboard)/tools/document-analyzer/page.tsx` - Removed blocking, added info
2. `components/ui/usage-guard.tsx` - Updated warning component
3. `components/ui/usage-info.tsx` - New minimal info component

## Result
Users now have full access to explore tools with clear, non-blocking information about their usage status. The backend APIs continue to enforce all restrictions appropriately, providing clear upgrade guidance when limits are reached.
